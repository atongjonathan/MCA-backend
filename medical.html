                        <h4>Financial Protection:</h4> 
                        <p>When you have medical insurance, you won't have to bear the full burden of your healthcare expenses. Instead, you pay a regular premium, which is like a membership fee that keeps your coverage active.</p>

                        <h4>Coverage for Medical Expenses:</h4> 
                        <p>Your insurance plan covers a range of medical services, including doctor visits, hospital stays, surgeries, and prescription medications. This means you can get the care you need without worrying about the entire cost.</p>

                        <h4>Deductibles and Co-payments:</h4> 
                        <p>Before your insurance kicks in, you may have a deductible, which is an amount you pay out of pocket. Once you've met the deductible, you might still have co-payments or co-insurance, but the insurance takes care of a significant portion of the expenses.</p>

                        <h4>Prescription Medications: </h4>
                        <p>Your insurance typically includes coverage for prescription medications. This ensures that you can afford the medications prescribed by your healthcare provider.</p>

                       <p>Remember, medical insurance is not just for emergencies; it's a tool to help you manage your health and well-being. By having coverage, you gain peace of mind knowing that you're financially protected when it comes to your healthcare needs. It's important to choose a plan that aligns with your needs and preferences, considering factors like premiums, deductibles, and the network of providers available."</p>
